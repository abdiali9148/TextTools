# Software Development Plan

Phase 0: Requirements Analysis
------------------------------
*(20% of your effort)*

**Important - do not change the starter code in this phase.**  Feel free to write prototype files and experiment in the REPL, but it's too early to work on the starter code now.


Deliver:

*   [ ] Re-write the instructions in your own words.
    *   If you don't do this, you won't know what you're supposed to do!
    *   Don't leave out details!
*   [ ] Explain the problem this program aims to solve.
    *   Describe what a *good* solution looks like.
    *   List what you already know how to do.
    *   Point out any challenges that you can foresee.
*   [ ] List all of the data that is used by the program, making note of where it comes from.
*   [ ] Explain what form the program's output will take.


Phase 1: Design
---------------
*(30% of your effort)*

**Important - do not change the starter code in this phase.**  Feel free to write prototype files and experiment in the REPL, but it's too early to work on the starter code now.

Deliver:

*   [ ] Pseudocode that captures how each function works in plain language.
    *   Pseudocode != Python.  Do not paste your finished source code into this part of the plan.
    *   Describe important functions and classes in your program.  Include such details as:
        *   Names of functions/classes
        *   Parameter names and their types
        *   Types of data returned by functions
*   [ ] Explain what happens in the face of good and bad input.
    *   As you think of specific examples, write them under **Phase 3** so you can run them as soon as the program is functional.


Phase 2: Implementation
-----------------------
*(15% of your effort)*

**Finally, you can write code!**

Deliver:

*   [ ] Working code in the `src/` folder.
*   [ ] Note any relevant and interesting events that happened while you wrote the code.
    *   e.g. what you learned, what didn't go according to plan.


Phase 3: Testing and Debugging
------------------------------
*(30% of your effort)*

Your grade depends on how your program performs when run from the command line.  We don't use PyCharm to grade, so ensure your program runs correctly from the shell.

Deliver:

*   [ ] A set of test cases that you have personally run on your computer.
    *   Write your test cases in plain language such that a non-coder could run them and replicate your experience.
    *   Include a description of what happened for *each test case*.
    *   For any bugs discovered, describe their cause and remedy.
